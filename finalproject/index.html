      <h2>What is a unicycle, what is unicycling, and why should you get into it?</h2>
      <div class="center" style="text-align:center;"> 
		  <P>A unicycle is a vehicle that touches the ground with only one wheel. 
			The most common variation has a frame with a saddle, and has a pedal-driven direct drive. 
			A two speed hub is commercially available for faster unicycling. 
			Unicycling is practiced professionally in circuses, by street performers, in festivals, and as a hobby. 
			Unicycles have also been used to create new sports such as unicycle hockey. 
			In recent years, unicycles have also been used in mountain unicycling, 
			an activity similar to mountain biking or trials.</P> 
		  <img src="media/unicycle (2).jpg" alt="unicycle" > 
		  <p>Riding a unicycle is really great exercise, even if you aren’t looking at getting one for mountain biking. 
			Even just learning to ride a unicycle on a flat and even surface will require great dedication to practice as well as great strength, 
			balance and coordination just to stay aloft. 
			It takes so much more to effectively navigate a unicycle over and around obstacles or up and down slopes, 
			all of which things you will find in the real world and on mountain trails.</p>
		  <img src="media/unicycle-kid.jpg" alt="unicycle kid" > 
		  <p>Even kids can unicycle. 
			  I think unicycling is a great sport for people to get into, not only for the novolty but also the exersize and fun. 
			  Even just traversing your house can be great fun on a unicycle. 
			  weather you may be riding in the liveing room or hoping up a step.

	<h2>Different Types Of Unicycling</h2>
    <h3>(hover over the quote to see the book title)</h3>
    <p class="box tip">	  
		<cite>Freestyle
			<span>This is a term used to describe the unicycle competition where music, movement and high skill level are mixed. 
				The most common size for freestyle is a 20" wheel. Freestyle unicycles have slick tyres to help with tricks. 
				At Unicycle.com we also use the term 'freestyle' to describe the basic ranges of unicycles that are suitable 
				for majority of tricks and games, like unicycle hockey or basketball.		
			</span> 
		</cite> 
	  </p>
    <p class="box tip"> 
		<cite>Road
			<span>
				It would not be sensible to use a 20"unicycle to commute to work or school, 
				but there are unicycles suitable for this, these we refer to as road unicycles. 
				They generally have larger wheels and proportionally shorter cranks. 
				36” wheel sized Unicycles are capably for speeds exceeding 20mph but can cruise along comfortably between 12-15mph. 
				Smaller wheel sizes will generally move a bit slower, but this can be altered by choosing different length cranks.
				Road Unicycles can also be used on Bridleways and smoother forest tracks when a fitted with an off-road tyre. 
				The addition of a Schlumpf geared unicycle hub can increase the speed of a smaller wheel to that of a larger wheel. 
				These larger wheeled unicycles are suitable for riders who are just starting out.

    <p class="box tip"> 
		<cite>Muni
			<span> This is the commonly known abbreviation among unicyclists for Mountain Unicycling. 
				Muni was originally used by Pashley for their range of off-road unicycles but is now used to mean any off-road unicycle. 
				Off-road unicycles must be very strong and generally have wide knobbly tyres and can be fitted with a brake. 
				The wheel size can vary with 24" and 26” for technical Muni and jumping, and 27.5” and 29" for covering greater distances. 
				Unicycles with splined & ISIS hubs and cranks are much stronger than cotter-less

		<h2>Unicycle History:</h2>
	  <P>The unicycle's history began with the invention of the bicycle. Comte De Sivrac first developed bicycles during the late eighteenth century. His device, called a celerifere, was a wooden horse that had two wheels joined by a wooden beam. In 1816, wooden, riding horses like these had become improved by the addition of a steering mechanism. In 1840, Kirkpatrick Macmillan introduced a mechanism for powering the hobbyhorse with his feet. During the 1860s significant progress was made with the introduction of rubber tires, metal spoke wheels, and ball bearing hubs. During 1866, James Starley invented a unique bicycle called the Penny Farthing. It is this vehicle that is thought to be the inspiration for the unicycle.</P>
